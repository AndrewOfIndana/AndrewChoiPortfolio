    <h3>Racear Tycoon (Personal programming project)</h3>
    <p>Another personal project I have worked on, the point of this game is to drive laps around the track and earn money. The money can be used to buy more ads to earn money, or upgrades to the car to either make it fast or slow. The player must balance speed and contorl in order to maximize the fastest build of the car. The player must race BIG RED the final and only boss of the game to win.</p>
