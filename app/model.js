    <h3>Solar Strife</h3>
    <p>A board game created by Macrohard, a team comprising of me and multiple fine gentlemen, in n132. The game is a two-player multiplayer game, where both players control a fleet of ships and attempt to either destroy the enemy fleet, capture the greatest number of planets, or capture their opponent's home planet. The player controls a wide variety of ships with different sizes, firing options, health, and abilities. Along the way the players may encounter meteors which can block ships and anomalies which can give the player chance cards that can boost the player's capabilities.</p>

    <h3>Racear Tycoon (Personal programming project)</h3>
    <p>Another personal project I have worked on, the point of this game is to drive laps around the track and earn money. The money can be used to buy more ads to earn money, or upgrades to the car to either make it fast or slow. The player must balance speed and contorl in order to maximize the fastest build of the car. The player must race BIG RED the final and only boss of the game to win.</p>
