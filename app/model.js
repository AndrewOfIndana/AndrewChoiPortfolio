            <p>
                Solar Strife is a board game made by MacroHard, a team comprising of me and multiple fine gentlemen. In the team I played the role of artist and game designer, coming up with the original concept for the game. The game is a two-player competitive multiplayer where both players control a fleet of ships in space. To win, either player must either capture as many planets as possible before the time limit, capture their opponents home planet to automatically win the match, or wipe out the opponent's fleet. the player controls a wide variety of ships with different sizes, each with their own, firing directions, health, and speed. Along side planets, the player can encounter asteroids which can block ships and projectiles, and anomalies that can grant the player chance cards that can turn the tide of battle.

            <p>
                As mentioned before, each ship has their own unique capabilities which gives each ship a value and use. Before I go into each ship, I should discuss the shield system, each ship is technically a single life point, and if it is hit it will be destroyed immediately, to negate this each ship can start with any number of shields, which when hit, will take the blow. The max amount of shields a ship can have is two, which means, a ship with max shields can take three hits before being sunk. Now to move to ships, first is the Scout which is smallest ship, taking only one tile, and is the fastest ship being able to move three spaces per turn. The Scout is also the weakest ship only being able to fire from the front up to six tiles, as well as starting with zero shields, meaning it can only take one hit. The next ship is the Monitor, which is a medium class ship, being two tiles long, and only being able to move two spaces. The ship can fire in the cardinal direction up to six tiles, the ship also starts with one shield, allowing it to take two hits. The next ship is the Cruiser which almost has the same capabilities as the Monitor, having the same number shields, the same ship size, the same ship speed, and attack range, the only differences being that it can fire from the diagonals instead of in a cross. Finally the last ship is the Dreadnought, being the largest ship, being an incredible three tiles long, at the cost of being the slowest, moving one tile per turn. The Dreadnought also has the special abilities to the fire in every direction up to twelve spaces, making it a deadly ship to fight against. The ship also starts with two shields, making it able to tank three hits before sinking. When the player starts, they can arrange their ships in any order in the first three rows allowing the player to play with formations and defense. The players take turns moving ships and positioning them towards planets or towards the enemy fleet. To add further detail, each ship was 3d printed by one of my teammates, making them very cool to look at and play with. Not only that but each fleet is modeled differently allowing the player to know which ship is theirs and not their opponents. Originally our board game was actually based on Chess and, though the game went through many changes to which led to the finished product being completely removed from Chess, a lot of details and mechanics did carry over, like the firing pattern of certain ships being like how certain pieces in Chess moved. Despite saying this, our game has more than enough original idea and mechanics to the point where previous play-testers didn't recognized the game since they first played. I just wanted to mention where certain inspiration came into play, when designing our game.

    <h4>The Map</h4>
    <div class="projectRow">
        <div class="projectTextRight">
            <p>
                As I explained earlier, the map contains asteroids, planets, and anomalies. When the player starts, they will place their ships in the first three rows at each end, this is designated by the striped lines on each end. The player may also notice a planet within these striped lines, this is the player home planet, if an enemy ship captures the player's home planet, the player loses automatically. Outside of the striped lines, are asteroids which the player can not move ship on top of, or shoot past, additionally asteroids can also be used for cover. Next are planets which when the player moves a ship on top of it, after one turn, they will capture that planet, planets determine which player has won if the time limit has been reach, but more importantly planets can be used to teleport ships on to said planet, this is how the player can move slower ships closer to the battlefield. Finally the last thing is anomalies which are the question marks found on the board. When the player lands on top of one, they can receive a chance card which can help or hinder the player.

    <h4>Chance and Wild Cards</h4>
        <p>
            When testing earlier, we found that the game is really difficult for player who didn't capture the middle planet first, to work around this, we implement the chance card system which allowed the player to gain an advantage though chance. As mentioned earlier when the player lands on an anomaly tile, they can draw a chance card, which can range from an item, like a powerful missile or a defection shield, a status effect like increased range or speed, or can be situational effect like a Scout being able to bring down a Dreadnought, but only when they are close. The player should note that not all chance cards can be positive as some chance cards can hinder the player. The player can hold three chance cards which allows the player to use items and effects at the right moment. The player should also note that the player must discard a chance card if they draw another chance card, meaning if the player has three good chance cards and draws a negative card, they must discard one of their positive cards and take the negative one. Moving on to wild cards, if they player loses a ship, they can draw a wild card which can a variety of positive and negative outcomes, some positive can range from the player gaining a power status effect to the ship receiving a full recovery in health. However the negative can also range from the player losing one ship to mutiny, to the player losing the ability to teleport. Unlike chance cards, the player can only hold one wildcard. Other than that, these mechanics add a little bit more randomness and variety to this game allowing for both players having a more equal chance of winning.

                When I made this game with my team, we had tried to make the game as easy to understand as humanly possible, however, we realize how much care and effort really needs to be put into explaining the rules of games. I say this because when it came to playtesting with actual people, we found that our rules were really hard to understand. This taught my team, that a game can be really fun and enjoyable, but if the players don't understand the rules, then everything that we work towards might as well be thrown down the drain. Despite this, though the game is a little crude to look at and is hindsight has allowed me to see the critical flaws in its gameplay and mechanics, I still look fondly at this game and the enjoyment I felt making the game. It was as fun making the thing as it was to play it.

<h3>Unreal 4 Level</h3>

        <div class="projectTextRight">
            <p>
                This is a level that was made in Unreal Engine 4 fully built by me. The level takes place in a destroyed city and the player's goal is to move to follow the path back home while jumping over basic obstacles. The game also has interactable features, including a teleporting volume at the bottom of the level that will teleport the player back to the beginning of the level if the player falls, as well as a volume that triggers light to turn on when the player gets close. The narrative for the world goes as follows, the player lives in a dystopian future where the world is essentially covered in urban architecture, the player must navigate through the mess of buildings, infrastructure and roads to get to where they need to go.

                For this level I really wanted to push the environment and immersion of the level since I wouldn't be able to add fun mechanics at the time. I did this by using environmental storytelling, as well as the use of fog, lighting, and post processing. As for what I have, the level does feel like what I have originally envisioned, the player being on the rooftop of a city that is stacked on top more city. I really impressed myself at the time because I was having trouble making the level feel like what I had envisioned in my head. If I could, I would want to rebuild the level and include more obstacles, areas to explore, and even more places where the player could see signs of life.

                The entire level had taught me how to make an interesting world and backdrop, I really loved messing around with the setting and lighting to bring out an atmospheric setting. I remember that my favorite part of the project was placing down buildings and playing with point of view, the player wouldn't be able to see past certain viewpoints, so there was no need to add areas where the player could not go to. What I think I could work on is making the actual level, in my level, I ended up focusing on the background way more than the actual level causing the level itself to feel barren and uninteresting, I feel like next time I should really think about what the player can do and where they can go instead of thinking of the background first. Other than that, this level helped me understand atmosphere and environment and I hope to continue to understand further.

<h3>My Favorite Game</h3>
<div class="projectContent">
    <div class="projectEssay">
        <p>
            My favorite game is Pikmin 2, a real-time strategy game made by Nintendo, where the player must command an army of tiny little creatures called Pikmin to carry treasure, perform tasks, and fight enemies. Compared to other more successful games, the Pikmin franchise was never really a best seller, compared to other Nintendo games, the game appeals to small audience of players, and the installment itself is polarizing to the greater fandom. Polarizing due to either people not liking certain additions in this installment, while others like me absolutely love the changes that was made for this game. Despite all of this, the reason why Pikmin 2 is my favorite game is because out of all three games in the franchise, Pikmin 2 has charmed me the most in terms of gameplay, immersion, and presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pikmin 2's gameplay can be summarized as so: the player controls two captains, Olimar and Louie, both captains can move with an analog stick and the player can also pan the camera in the direction the captain that is under the player's control is facing through a button. The player can switch between captain with a button which, allows the player to divide workloads, not only that but, the player can also blow a whistle at the cursor, which is used to call Pikmin over to you. In game Pikmin, can either be in two states, free and following, free Pikmin, are Pikmin that are not called by the captain, when they are close to an item, obstacle, or enemy, they will automatically carry the item, or destroy the obstacle or enemy. When the player uses their whistle to call Pikmin they will be in a following state and will follow the captain, while in this state the player can throw Pikmin, which will allow them to reach better areas and fight better. The game involves the player uses Pikmin to carry treasure back to their ship, under a time limit in the form of day to night. The incentive of all three games is to get as much done in a day, ultimately culminating in trying to finish the game in the least number of days. This is one of the things I really love about the Pikmin series, when I was younger, during each summer I would try to beat each game with the least number of days, I remember my first time playing it the number of days was 20, then I replayed it shortened it to 14, and then I replayed it even further to 12. In my mind I feel like Pikmin 2 is the best for this because it hit the balance between being replayable, being a game I will come back to from time to time, and is fulfilling enough with its content, each day feeling like I did more than just 13 to 18 minutes of gameplay. As the player progresses through each area, they will encounter more Pikmin types, each with their own advantages and weaknesses, allowing for the player to strategize how they should tackle a certain task. An example would be if the player needs to get across lake and destroy an electric fence, they will need blue Pikmin to cross the water, and build a bridge, and then they will need yellow Pikmin to tear down the electric fence. Finally Pikmin 2's defining gameplay element that separates it from other installments in the series, is the caves, which are a series of procedural generated mazes separated by sublevels. Each sublevel contains treasures and challenges in the form of difficult enemies and elemental hazards, the caves also stop time limit for the day, allowing the player to freely explore each sublevel without having worry. For the fandom the caves are very polarizing, on one hand it feels out of place and disrupted to the normal gameplay loop of meticulously planning out the day, while on the other hand, the caves bring out a sense of exploration and challenge that isn't seen much in other Pikmin titles. For me the caves are my favorite part of the game, I always like the dungeon crawling genre, and I feel like the cave are what makes each day feel so eventful. On game design standpoint I also like how the caves encourage different play styles, the caves can be played quickly and riskily, but if that isn't what player wants, they can also be played methodologically as well. There is more to say about the gameplay, but I think I should move on to the presentation and how the game charms me through story and character.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pikmin 2 in my opinion is the one with the most personality out of the franchise, it achieves this through is effort given in its presentation. Firstly is its dialogue, and text, though the player character does not speak in game, other characters like the president, or your own ship do speak through dialogue text, some of the text may not be nothing special, but other times they can be quite humorous, a good example being how the ship dislike bugs, and when you carry a bug carcass back to the ship for the first time you are greeted the ship opening dialoguing about how much it dislike you for doing that. Another example of the game's writing is through its mail system, when the player finishing a day, they will receive three screens, one to tell how much money the player has earned, another for how many Pikmin were grown/killed, and finally a screen that display mail that the captains can receive from either their boss, their families, or even just spam. The contents of each mail can tell a short story of what is going on in the lives of each captain, how Olimar, the main character, just wants to spend more time with his wife and kids, how the president tries to hide from debt collectors by hiding under a bridge, each mail give more insight to world of Pikmin. Finally the best example of Pikmin 2's charm is in the form of the catalogue for each enemy, the Piklopedia, and treasures, the treasure horde. First the Piklopedia is the game's catalogue for each enemy, the player can look at how much each enemy is worth, how many they have killed, and how many Pikmin have they eaten. However if the player clicks on the side buttons they will be greeted to log from each captain, Olimar's log would discuss the enemy's behavioral patterns and other biological facts, while Louie's log would detail how to cook the enemy and serve it n a platter. Though unnecessary these tidbits add more flavor to the game and helps the game feel more alive, instead of just being enemies, each enemy is a creature with their own behaviors and habitats. The other catalogue is the treasure horde, which displays each treasure that the player collects, just like before by clicking the side buttons they will be given a log by the Olimar, but instead of Louie, they get the ship's sales pitch for the treasure. There are other smaller things that add to the charm of Pikmin 2, but I think we should move on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally I want to talk about the flaws in Pikmin 2, even though I love this game, even I understand that the game isn't perfect. To start, we can talk about how unbalanced the game is, in Pikmin 2, the strongest Pikmin is the purple Pikmin, not only does it do double damage compared to other Pikmin, but they can also carry 10 times the normal amount, have a homing attack when thrown, can stun enemies by landing near them, and are immune to panicking, and wind. purple Pikmin breaks the game's balance, enemies that would be tough with other Pikmin are made into joke and can be taken down easily. The game tries to balance this by making purple Pikmin hard to grow, but the player can abuse certain caves to receive a lot of purple Pikmin. The player could try not to use purple Pikmin, but then they would lose out on 100% completion due to the fact that one treasure weight 1000 Pikmin. Another flaw is this game's challenge mode. In challenge mode players must go through caves but under a time limit, before I said that the caves could be complete with enough patience and time, but in challenge mode this is thrown out of the window. I get what they were trying to do, adding urgency to challenge the player, but instead they just made exploring the caves in challenge mode much more stressful and unfun. Despite all of this, however, I still enjoy Pikmin 2 and these complaints come from a place of love.
        </p>
        <p>
            To finally conclude, Pikmin 2 is one of my most favorite games I have ever played. Though the game does have its problems both frustrating and small, the enjoyment and charm that the game has given me far exceeds and of those problems.

                I started by planning out how the game would be like, whether it would be in 2d or 3d, and thinking about what features need to be implemented. Next, I would make the project and set everything up, importing assets and setting up the camera angle. Then I would set up the visual aspect first by making a table and putting down some cards. Then came the coding process, which, though I watched a tutorial to base the programming on, I made most if not all of the code myself by using what I knew along with what the tutorial was teaching. Finally I connect my scripts with my game objects, and add post processing, and props to further enhance game feel.

                Despite the fact that this game was easily made, due to a lot of the work in the form of assets and general direction being done already, and the fact that memory isn't that difficult to program, I still find pride in my work. I also impressed with how fast I was able to make my game, which helps me understand that with enough planning, and experimenting, the game making process can be made easier.

            <p>
                Seeds N' Scrap is a personal project, in Unity, that me and William Rubino, a co-developer, have been making for some time. The game is a first-person tower defense game where the player must defend their house from a horde of robotic bugs, using mechanical plant hybrid crops which act like towers. The player must learn how to manage time fighting bugs, and nurturing crops. The game is currently in WIP and has been for sometime, but even if the game will never finished, I have learned a lot about programming and using Unity from this project.

                Crops are the towers of this game, without them, the player will lose to the endless hordes of bugs. To get a crop, the player must buy the seeds from the market, from there, the seeds will drop from the air and the player can grab the seeds and plant it in a soil tile. After planting, the crop will take time before it is fully matured, the player can water the plant to increase its score, as well as depending on the quality of the soil this can also increase the crops score. By increasing score the crop may receive a bonus to its stats depending on the amount of care it was given. The player must also sell crops to make money in order to buy more, stronger crops, upgrades, and even power ups. Throughout the game, the player must manage time, and resources to maximize profits, while defending their home.

                As mentioned before the player can use a water can to water plants, they can also use water hoses to refill any water they use. They also have a shotgun which fire two shots before reloading, is powerful during the first couple of rounds, but is quickly made useless without upgrades, in the later rounds. Finally the player can also use a shovel which can sell crops for money, which can be used to buy more crops, upgrades, and other things. The crops themselves are very simple they will shoot at any bug that is nearby, depending on the crop they can fire missiles, bullets, lasers, and more. The player should use their crops to defend their home while also selling them to grow more crops to stay one step ahead of the bugs, as they will become stronger and faster as the rounds progress.

                Looking back, I was really invested in this project, I would spend most if not all of my free time making this project work, so what do I think now. Right now, I feel burnt out from this project, all of the vigor that I had back then has kind of faded and now I no longer want to work on this anymore. One might ask, why feature this if I no longer like it as much as I did back then? This is because, This project has been the greatest learning process I have ever partook in. This project has not only taught me how to program with Unity, but it had also taught me to lower my expectation when it came to my own goals, originally I thought we should have implemented boss battles, building, and even multiplayer, but now I understand that burnout is a real thing that happens, and I shouldn't have made all those plans when I didn't even start making the basic framework for the game. Right now, the game is in hiatus, neither my partner nor I was to continue to work, but I think that is alright, because the lessons I have learned from making this game continue to help me even now.

                Another personal project I have worked on, the point of this game is to drive laps around the track and earn money. The money can be used to buy more ads to earn money, or upgrades to the car to either make it fast or slow. The player must balance speed and contorl in order to maximize the fastest build of the car. The player must race BIG RED the final and only boss of the game to win.

    <h4>Reflection and Plans for Overhauling</h4>
    <div class="projectRow">
        <p>
            This is a game that I am not proud of at this state, I made this because I felt like I needed to make it for this portfolio. However I can say that I started to really think about how I could make this game fun, and I started to think about what where I could take this project. My plan for this project is to completely overhaul the story, objective and even feel of the game, instead of driving on one racetrack, the player will drive multiple cars across differently layers representing the solar system. Each track which will have a designated planet, will have different stipulations and rules to them, for example the Jupiter track is the longest track and has slowest car in the game, despite this if the player finishes a lap they will receive a large sum of money compared to other tracks, while another example would be the mars track where the player doesn't control any cars but has to bet their money one of the two cars, Phobos and Deimos, and if their car wins the race they win the bet. Just like the previous project, the player must tinker and experiment with their car for each layer, to get optimal speed and control. I also plan on adding a ending goal, that being reach the outer layer of solar system. I also plan to add more game feel to my game, since the current version lack a lot of flare and personality. Other than that, my plans are going to need some time, but when I get to this project, I should be ready to tackle what I outlined in this paragraph.
